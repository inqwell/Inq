Welcome to Inq

Inq is a scripting language and execution environment for
enterprise client/server applications. Its server manages
database persistence, transactions events, locks and
processes. Its client supports rapid GUI building and
full MVC for easy state-driven applications.

Inq makes heavy use of reification, so an application
developer writes almost no boilerplate at all. Everything
is a map, meaning relationships are defined at runtime and
applications are more easily maintained.
